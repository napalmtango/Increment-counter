# Increment-counter
A simple counter

This counter app allows the user to increment a value, initialized at zero, by one by clicking the "Increment" button. By clicking the "Save/Reset" button the app displays the current value following the text "Previous entries: " and then resets the counter to zero, allowing for a new count to begin. On subsequent Save/Reset the count value is appended to the to the Previou entries in order to keep a running total of counts. Example: "Previous entries: 5 - 2 -17" and so on.
